Alertify notifies drivers to make space for emergency vehicles
One can login as user if he/she wants to contribute to the cause. Or one can login as Emergency Vehicle driver who is currently driving it.

Working
In both case we take live location of users using forground services and notification channel and store them in oue firbase database.
If an emergency vehicle is aroung half kilometer radius of the user , the user will get notified with the ambulances location so user can take some measure to prevent it.
At last we use google maps api to present the Emergency services as well as user.

For Emergency vehicles to register he must register through our app version where he will be provided with username and password to do so
Here is our dummy username and password for usage
username = user
password = 1234
The user authentication is done using firebase too.

In India more than 24,000 people die everyday :( due to delay in emergency services . Our project works on the very same problem. 
Also app works 100%.
